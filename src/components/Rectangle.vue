          <p>
            In 2017, the Board of Directors decided to work on this project at
            the national level and asked the research team to work on producing
            smart electric meters which would never have a similar prototype.
            Our company had the experience of designing smart home and
            industrial electronic circuit boards which perform like a smart
            meter. Subsequently, following these experiences helped us to
            succeed in building a cumulative smart meter after nearly two years.
            We met our goals with this one.
